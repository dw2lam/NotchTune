# NotchTune

Why switch contexts when your notch can keep the flow together?

**NotchTune** is a native macOS companion that turns your Mac's notch, or a compact top bar on external displays, into a live control surface for music and terminal-native AI agents. It combines playback controls, agent monitoring, approvals, questions, and session jump-back in one lightweight local app.

## Highlights

- **Dynamic notch switching**: NotchTune moves between Music and Agents automatically, so the island can show the thing that matters now: current playback, active agent work, permission prompts, questions, or recently completed sessions.
- **Music controls**: Control Spotify or Apple Music from the notch, including playback, track details, artwork, progress, shuffle, repeat, love, volume, and quick open actions.
- **Agent monitoring**: Track local coding-agent sessions from the menu bar or notch, including running state, waiting approvals, questions, completions, subagents, and usage summaries.
- **Character personalization**: Choose the island character that fits your setup, including dino, cat, and dog appearances.
- **Notch-aware layouts**: Runs as a real notch surface on MacBook displays and falls back to a clean top-center bar on external or non-notch screens.
- **Local and native**: Built with SwiftUI and AppKit. No Electron shell, no telemetry, and no remote server dependency.

## Supported Integrations

NotchTune currently supports Spotify and Apple Music for playback.

For coding agents, it supports Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Gemini CLI, Kimi CLI, Qoder, Qwen Code, Factory, and CodeBuddy through local hooks, transcript discovery, and process matching where available.

Supported terminal jump-back includes Terminal.app, Ghostty, cmux, Kaku, WezTerm, iTerm2, and tmux. Warp support is planned.

## Quick Start

Clone and run the app locally:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dw2lam/open-vibe-island-music.git
cd open-vibe-island-music
swift run OpenIslandApp
```

Or open the package in Xcode:

```bash
open Package.swift
```

Build the hook helper when you want NotchTune to receive local agent events:

```bash
swift build -c release --product OpenIslandHooks
```

Then open NotchTune settings and install hooks for the agents you use.

## Development

This repository is a Swift package with four main products:

- `OpenIslandApp`: the native SwiftUI/AppKit app
- `OpenIslandCore`: models, bridge transport, hook installers, and session state
- `OpenIslandHooks`: the CLI called by agent hooks
- `OpenIslandSetup`: setup utilities for managed hook installation

Useful commands:

```bash
swift build
swift test
swift run OpenIslandApp
```

## Credits

NotchTune builds on work from:

- [Tuneful](https://github.com/martinfekete10/Tuneful), originally developed by [Martin Fekete](https://github.com/martinfekete10), for native macOS playback controls and interface ideas.
- [Open Island](https://github.com/Octane0411/open-vibe-island), originally developed by [Octane0411](https://github.com/Octane0411), for dynamic notch integration and terminal-native AI tracking foundations.

## What's Next

More connectors, personalization options, and deeper agent workflows are planned as NotchTune continues to grow into a local-first control surface for music and coding agents.
